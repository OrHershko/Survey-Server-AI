# Project Reflection - Survey Server with AI Summarization

## How the Team Split the Work

### Collaborative Development Approach

Our team decided to work together rather than traditional work division. The majority of development was conducted through shared sessions on Discord, primarily using Or and Tom's computers as development environments.

### Work Distribution Strategy

- **We made all the big decisions together**: Instead of having one person decide on architecture or design choices, we'd hop on Discord and hash things out as a group. It felt more natural and everyone had a voice.
- **We built everything side by side**: Rather than saying "you take the frontend, I'll do the backend," we literally worked on the same features together. Sometimes one person would drive while others watched and suggested changes.
- **Everyone pitched in equally**: Whether it was writing code, spotting bugs, or coming up with solutions when we got stuck, all four of us were actively involved. No one was just sitting back.
- **We could fix problems instantly**: When someone spotted an issue or had a better idea, we could address it right away instead of waiting for a code review later.

## How and Where AI Tools Were Used

### Primary AI Tools

#### 1. **Cursor IDE**
- Primary development environment for writing and refactoring code
- Used for:
  - Code generation and completion
  - Debugging assistance
  - Code optimization suggestions
  - Documentation generation

#### 2. **ChatGPT**
- Strategic planning and prompt engineering
- Used for:
  - Better understanding of project requirements and exercises
  - Writing more effective prompts for Cursor
  - Architectural decision guidance
  - Problem-solving approach development

## Lessons Learned and Challenges Faced

### Key Lessons Learned

#### 1. **Prompt Engineering Mastery**
- Adding the word "investigate" to prompts significantly improved AI responses
- **Impact**: More thorough analysis and better code suggestions
- **Application**: Applied this technique throughout the project for better results

**Example**: 
- **Before**: "How to implement authentication?"
- **After**: "implement secure JWT authentication with proper error handling, Investigate the code before Implementing"

#### 2. **AI-First Planning Approach**
- Start with AI-generated comprehensive plans before coding
- **Benefit**: Reduced development time and improved code structure
- **Process**: Plan → Review → Implement → Iterate

### Challenges Faced

#### 1. **Work Division Coordination**
- **Challenge**: Initial difficulty in efficiently dividing tasks among team members
- **Solution**: Shifted to collaborative development approach
- **Learning**: Sometimes working together is more effective than working separately

#### 2. **Prompt Optimization**
- **Challenge**: Initial AI responses were sometimes too generic or incomplete
- **Solution**: Discovered the "investigate" keyword and other prompt engineering techniques
- **Learning**: Prompt quality directly impacts development efficiency

#### 3. **Technology Integration**
- **Challenge**: Integrating multiple technologies (React, Express, MongoDB, AI APIs)
- **Solution**: Used AI-assisted planning to break down complex integrations
- **Learning**: AI tools are excellent for managing complex technology stacks
