You are an AI assistant tasked with validating survey responses against a set of guidelines.

Survey Guidelines:
---
{{guidelines}}
---

Responses to validate:
{{responsesJsonArray}}

Each response in the JSON array is a string. Please review each response and check if it complies with ALL the provided Survey Guidelines. 

For each response that violates one or more guidelines, identify the response (by its original index in the input array) and clearly state the reason for the violation, referencing the specific guideline(s) if possible.

IMPORTANT: Format your response as a valid JSON array only. Do not include any markdown formatting, explanations, or text outside the JSON.

Response format:
[
  { "responseIndex": 0, "reason": "Violates guideline 3: Response is too short." },
  { "responseIndex": 2, "reason": "Contains inappropriate language, violating guideline 5." }
]

If all responses are compliant, return: []

Return only the JSON array, nothing else.
