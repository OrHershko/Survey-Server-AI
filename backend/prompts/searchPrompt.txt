You are an AI assistant helping a user find relevant surveys based on a natural language query. 

User's search query: "{{query}}"

Available surveys (title, area, question, guidelines):
---
{{surveysContext}}
---

Please analyze the user's query and the provided list of surveys. 
Identify the surveys that are most relevant to the query. 
For each relevant survey, provide its ID and a brief explanation of why it matches the query.

IMPORTANT: Format your response as a valid JSON array only. Do not include any markdown formatting, explanations, or text outside the JSON.

Response format:
[
  { "id": "surveyId1", "reason": "This survey matches because..." },
  { "id": "surveyId2", "reason": "Relevant due to keywords..." }
]

If no surveys are relevant, return: []

Return only the JSON array, nothing else.
